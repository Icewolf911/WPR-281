- [ ] Basic Layout(Conrad#)
- [x] Person object(JJ)
- [x] lettersOnly(Justin) 
- [x] nubersOnly(Justin) 
- [x] emailValid(Justin) 
- [ ] randomRefrence 
- [ ] checkCode
- [ ] resefForm
- [ ] formValid
- [ ] noSpecialCharceters

Justin: I have completed the lettersOnly and numbersOnly functions, I have kept the console.log() if you want to see how it gets the values (not important can remove if needed.)

JJ: I added a noSpecialCharecters function since I think the name and surname should not be allowed to have something like @ signs and so on

~~Side note: I think the globalPerson should be changed because all of them say: "globalPerson.**first-name**" meaning first-name has the value of email, last-name, ID and so on.~~  *(fixed)*
